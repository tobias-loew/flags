## Why use Boost.Flags?

* provides type-safe bitwise operations for flag-like scoped / unscoped enumerations
* turns undetected logical errors into type errors
// ** when applying bitwise operators to incompatible enumerations
// ** when accidentally converting bitmasks (negation of flags) to `bool`

## Characteristics of Boost.Flags

* is non-intrusive - only a function overload or a template specializations required to opt-in
* single header-file library
* no dependencies (only standard-library includes)
* everything is `constexpr`
* zero-overhead in optimized builds
* operator are found by https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl[ADL,window=_blank]
* requires at least C++11, uses newer features if available
// * provides a bunch of bit manipulation utility functions
// * enforces additional type-checks for existing flag-like unscoped enumerations, while still allowing implicit conversion to `int` and `bool`

## Opt-in

To opt-in to Boost.Flags for an enumeration `E` the easiest and most comfortable way is to use the macro `BOOST_FLAGS_ENABLE` for `E` in the same namespace as `E`
[source]
----
BOOST_FLAGS_ENABLE(E)
----

// As Boost.Flags will call `boost_flags_enable` unqualified, it will be looked up using https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl[ADL,window=_blank].
Best practice would be writing `BOOST_FLAGS_ENABLE(E)` right after the enumeration in the same namespace.

In case the enumeration `E` is defined inside a class or class template, the macro `BOOST_FLAGS_ENABLE_LOCAL` has to be used for enabling:

[source]
----
class my_class {
    // ...
    enum class E:unsigned int { ... };
    BOOST_FLAGS_ENABLE_LOCAL(E)
    // ...
};
----

// Instead of defining `boost_flags_enable` the class template xref:types_enable[`boost::flags::enable`] can be specialized for enabling:
// [source]
// ----
// template<>
// struct boost::flags::enable<E> : std::true_type {};
// ----

In case you want to ensure that an enumeration is enabled for Boost.Flags, you can test it e.g. with
[source]
----
static_assert(boost::flags::enable<E>::value, "Please check if E is enabled correctly and boost/flags.hpp is included.");
----

## _scoped_ or _unscoped_ enumerations?

The usage of scoped enumeration is strongly recommended, as they provide more type safety than unscoped by prohibiting implicit conversion to the underlying integer type.

Nevertheless, for both kinds of enumerations Boost.Flags will detect semantical errors when using bitwise operations.

For unscoped enumerations Boost.Flags will delete binary operators `&`, `|`, `^`, `&&`, `||`, `==` and `!=` if

* at least one is enabled for Boost.Flags and
* both arguments are implicitly convertible to an integer type and
* both arguments are not compatible (they are not the same enumeration or its xref:complementing_the_complement[complement])

i.e. Boost.Flags will prohibit that in those cases the built-in version will be used. +
(For scoped enumerations this is not necessary, as those cases cannot occur.)

// (For scoped enumerations the language prohibits them anyway.) 
// 
// To test whether When testing for emptyness (i.e. the underlying value is `0`) an (in-)equality test against `nullptr` or the macro `BOOST_FLAGS_NULL` can be executed.
// For scoped enumerations an (in-)equality test against `0` produces the same result.


## What about the underlying type?

* For language standards **before C++20** the underlying type is required as an `unsigned` type, for both scoped and unscoped enumerations!
* For *unscoped* enumerations with the `disable_complement` option the underlying type is **always required**!

(For details xref:underlying_type[see below.])

# The long story

Why do we use the bits of integer types for Boolean options?

- easy to define, e.g. as macros, integer constants or enumerators
- language support for setting and querying through bitwise operators
- compact representation in memory
- simple bulk transfer in interfaces (on many platforms an `int` can hold up to 32 different Boolean options)
- enforces the usage of names, especially to prevent `bool` parameters in interfaces:
[quote, C. Martin (Uncle Bob), Clean Code]   
Boolean arguments loudly declare that the function does more than one thing. They are confusing and should be eliminated.

C++ has everything needed to work with flags, so why do we need Boost.Flags? 

Because we can do **too much** with them!

## Type-Safety

For flags based on integer-types or enumerations all values are implicitly convertible to `int`. The compiler can't help, when we accidentally apply binary operators to unrelated flags. 

Here's an example from the Win32-API: 

In `Windows.h` we find the listbox-style
[source]
----
#define LBS_NOTIFY            0x0001L
----
and the button-style
[source]
----
#define BS_NOTIFY           0x00004000L
----
If we forget the leading `L` of `LBS_NOTIFY` and write
[source]
----
    if (listbox_styles & BS_NOTIFY) { ... }
----
instead, we produced syntactically correct code but semantical nonsense. 

[discrete]
### Switching to enumerations makes it even worse
If the Windows team had decided to use unscoped enumerations instead of macros it wouldn't have helped: the arguments of built-in bitwise operators are subject to integral promotion, i.e. they forget about the enumeration's semantic overhead. Even worse:


* The built-in operators `&`, `|`, `^` and `~` return integer types. Assigning their results to enumeration-type variables require explicit casts, which is another source for errors undetectable by the compiler.
* The built-in operators `&=`, `|=`, `^=` require the left-hand type to be arithmetic, which excludes enumerations.
* Scoped enumerations (which didn't exist when `Windows.h` was created) prohibit implicit integral promotion and therefore don't work with built-in bitwise operators at all.


[discrete]
### But enumerations provide type-safety
On the other hand, enumerations, and especially scoped ones, improve the type-safety of our code:

* variables and arguments of enumeration type can only by assigned (resp. invoked) with a value of the same type
* no implicit integral promotion for scoped enumerations

[discrete]
### With Boost.Flags you can get both! 
With Boost.Flags we get support for all bitwise operators and type-safety. E.g. the following code
[source]
----
enum class E : unsigned int { a=1, b=2, c=4, d=8 };
BOOST_FLAGS_ENABLE(E)
----

* enables all the operators `~`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=` for `E` and `complement<E>` (xref:complementing_the_complement[see below])
* the binary operators require both arguments to be from the enumeration or its `complement`
* the bitwise negation `~` changes the type from `E` to `complement<E>` and vice-versa
// * all other operators are disabled by default (cf. xref:overloading_relational_operators[overloading relational operators])

// [#overloading_relational_operators]

// and return _appropriate_ types (_appropriate_ will be explained soon). 
// So, all the bitwise operators work for `E` as they did e.g. for the macros from `Windows.h`.
// Even more
// 
// * the bitwise negation `~` changes the type from `E` to `complement<E>` and vice-versa
// ** `operator~(E) \-> complement<E>`
// ** `operator~(complement<E>) \-> E`
// * the binary operators require both arguments to be of type `E` or `complement<E>` (resp. a reference of it)

Ok, the `unsigned` is more a theoretical issue, since all C\\++ compilers already used two's complement for signed integers, even before it got mandatory with C++20 (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types[, window=_blank]).
Furthermore, scoped enumerations always have a fixed underlying type, which is `int` if not specified (https://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.enum#5[, window=_blank]).

So, in case your compiler uses signed two's complement, you can use the following dicision diagram:

[#complement_UB]
It may seem pedantic, but defining the underlying type in the unscoped and xref:disable_complement[`disable_complement`] case is crucial, as otherwise the `operator ~` will invoke UB. +
Compilers can track this down, e.g. when evaluating constant expressions (cf. https://eel.is/c++draft/expr.static.cast#10[, window=_blank]). +
Starting with Clang 16 this is diagnosed as a hard error.

[NOTE]
====
For unscoped enums with unspecified underlying type, the compiler infers two types:

* the underlying type (https://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.enum#7[,window=_blank]), which we can query using `std::underlying_type`
* a hypothetical integer value type with minimal width such that all enumerators can be represented (https://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.enum#8[,window=_blank]) +
  "The width of the smallest bit-field large enough to hold all the values of the enumeration type [...]." 
  
//  This type is not deducible from the type of the enumeration. (It requires to know the values of all enumerators.)

This hypothetical integer value type is not deducible from the type of the enumeration. (It requires to know the values of all enumerators.) Furthermore, it is in general not the same as the underlying type. E.g.
[source]
----
enum TriBool {
    false_ = 0,
    true_ = 1,
    undefined = 2
};
----
has underlying type `int` on all major compilers, but its valid values are just 
`0`, `1`, `2` and `3` as the __hypothetical integer value type with minimal width__ is a 2-bit unsigned integer.

====


// Scoped enumerations are not affected: they get an https://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.enum#5[underlying type `int` if not specified, window=_blank].
// Ensure we do not leave the valid value range: would be UB for constant expressions!
// https://eel.is/c++draft/expr.static.cast#10[,window=_blank]
// https://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.enum#7[,window=_blank]
// https://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.enum#8[,window=_blank]
// 
// Still, for unscoped enums with unspecified underlying type, the problem is not solvable:
// The hypothetical integer value type is in general not the same as the deduced underlying type!
//
// E.g. clang reports warnings here, when used with unscoped enums with unspecified underlying type in constant expressions:
// error: integer value 4294967294 is outside the valid range of values [0, 15] for this enumeration type [-Wenum-constexpr-conversion]

## Complementing the `complement`

Before going into details, let me tell you a little tale

[#queen_of_hearts_tale]
====
+++<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">
Once, there was a kingdom, where the Queen of Hearts reigned with iron fist.<br/>She had her own newspaper for proclamations, where they used a set of flags for font-styles</span>+++
[source]
----
enum font_styles : unsigned int {
    bold      = 1,
    italic    = 2,
    underline = 4
};
// special style for the Queen's proclamations
static constexpr auto queen_of_hearts_name = italic | underline;
----
+++<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">
One of the Queen's proclamations had been:<br/> 
<span style="font-color:#FFD700; font-size:150%"">All my proclamations shall be encoded in C++, <i><u>the Queen</u></i>!</span> 
<br/>And there were loads of them every day. <br/>
A programmer for the newspaper, who was tired of typing <code>queen_of_hearts_name</code> all the time, figured out that typing <code>~bold</code> instead also did the job. This saved him a lot of work. <br/>
One day, the troublemaker Alice came to the kingdom and the Queen ordered the creation of a new font-style+++
[source]
----
    strikeout = 8
----
+++<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">
which should be used for Alice's name. So it got added to the `font_styles` enumeration.<br/>
The next day the following proclamation appeared in the newspaper:<br/>
<span style="font-size:150%">All persons whose names are striken out are enemies of the kingdom, <i><s><u>the Queen</u></s></i>!</span><br/> 
The last thing the programmer heard, as he ran away from the kingdom, was the queen shouting "Off with his head!".
+++
====
There are two morals of this tale:

* a *syntactical*: the negation flips all bits of the underlying integer. Even though `~bold` did the job in the beginning, it is different from `queen_of_hearts_name`. 
* a *semantical*: `~bold` isn't a set of font-modifications. Its purpose is to exclude boldness from a given set of flags.

// '

// By distinguishing `E` and `complement<E>` in the type system, we keep the set of flags of type `E` apart from the set of negative masks for `E`.
// 
// Here's a bit more realistic example: Imagine the following set of options for starting a process
// 
// [source]
// ----
// enum process_start_options : unsigned int {
//     run_in_background = 0x1,
//     start_with_elevated_privileges = 0x2,
//     enable_logging = 0x4
// };
// ----

In a nutshell: the following two operations on sets of flags return another set of flags 
// the semantics of a set of flags supports

* conjunction (`operator&`): taking the flags that appear in *all* sets
* disjunction (`operator|`): taking the flags that appear in *any* of the sets

but negation (`operator~`) in general *does not*. +
Sets of flags resemble the semantics of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)[mathematical lattices, window=_blank] rather than the semantics of a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(structure)[Boolean algebra,window=_blank].


## Mathematical justification for `complement`

This section provides a mathematical explanation, why `complement` is required. It can easily be xref:from_flags_to_bool[skipped].

* The underlying type `U` with the bitwise operations `~, &, |` and the constants `0` and `-1` (all bits set) form a _(bitcount of U)_-dimensional https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(structure)[Boolean algebra,window=_blank] pass:[<span style="font-size:115%">(<span style="font-style:italic">U</span>, 0, -1, &sim;, &amp;, &mid;)</span>] 
* The defined flags (e.g. `bold`, `italic` etc.) with the bitwise operations `&, |` form a substructure pass:[<span style="font-size:115%">(<span style="font-style:italic">F</span>, &amp;, &mid;)</span>] of pass:[<span style="font-size:115%;font-style: italic">U</span>] (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)[mathematical lattices, window=_blank]) which in general *is not closed under bitwise negation `~`*.
* Building the closure pass:[<span style="font-size:115%;font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration:overline">F</span></span>] of pass:[<span style="font-size:115%;font-style: italic">F</span>] wrt. pass:[<span style="font-size:115%">&sim;</span>] generates a Boolean algebra which is a Boolean subalgebra of pass:[<span style="font-size:115%;font-style: italic">U</span>].
// * The underlying type `U` with the bitwise operations `~, &, |` and the constants `0` and `-1` (all bits set) form a _(bitcount of U)_-dimensional https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(structure)[Boolean algebra,window=_blank] latexmath:[(U,0,-1,{\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}},\&,\mid)] 
// * The defined flags (e.g. `bold`, `italic` etc.) with the bitwise operations `&, |` form a substructure latexmath:[(F,\&,\mid)] of latexmath:[U] (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)[mathematical lattices, window=_blank]) which in general *is not closed under bitwise negation `~`*.
// * Building the closure latexmath:[\overline{F}] of latexmath:[F] wrt. latexmath:[{\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}}] generates a Boolean algebra which is a Boolean subalgebra of latexmath:[U].

Semantically the elements of pass:[<span style="font-size:115%;font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration:overline">F</span>&setminus; F</span>] are not combinations of flags but negative flag-masks. The distinction of `E` and `complement<E>` keeps them apart on the type-level. 
// Semantically the elements of latexmath:[\overline{F}\setminus F] are not combinations of flags but negative flag-masks. The distinction of `E` and `complement<E>` keeps them apart on the type-level. 

Finally, for the binary operators we have

* `operator&`
** `operator&(E, E) \-> E`
** `operator&(complement<E>, E) \-> E`
** `operator&(E, complement<E>) \-> E`
** `operator&(complement<E>, complement<E>) \-> complement<E>`

* `operator|`
** `operator|(E, E) \-> E`
** `operator|(complement<E>, E) \-> complement<E>`
** `operator|(E, complement<E>) \-> complement<E>`
** `operator|(complement<E>, complement<E>) \-> complement<E>`

* `operator^`
** `operator^(E, E) \-> E`
** `operator^(complement<E>, E) \-> complement<E>`
** `operator^(E, complement<E>) \-> complement<E>`
** `operator^(complement<E>, complement<E>) \-> E`


//Which means, on the meta-level the typeset latexmath:[\{\textrm{E}, \textrm{complement<E>} \}] and the operation latexmath:[{\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}}], latexmath:[\&] and latexmath:[\mid] form a two-element Boolean algebra.
Which means, on the meta-level the typeset pass:[<span style="font-size:115%">{E, complement&lt;E&gt;}</span>] and the operation pass:[<span style="font-size:115%">&sim;</span>], pass:[<span style="font-size:115%">&amp;</span>] and  pass:[<span style="font-size:115%">&mid; </span>] form a two-element Boolean algebra.

For the rare case where 

* the set of flags semantically forms a Boolean algebra and additionally
* all bits of the underlying type correspond to flags

there exists the option xref:disable_complement[`disable_complement`] which disables the usage of `complement` and sets `operator~(E) \-> E`. 


## From flags to `bool`

Since scoped enumerations prevent implicit conversion to `bool`, Boost.Flags provides the following functions (see also xref:not_not[`operator!`]):

* `any(e) \-> bool` : equivalent to `e != E{}`
* `none(e) \-> bool` : equivalent to `e == E{}`

Furthermore, to test for intersection and entailment of flag-sets:

* `intersect(e1, e2) \-> bool` : equivalent to `e1 & e2 != E{}`
* `disjoint(e1, e2) \-> bool` : equivalent to `e1 & e2 == E{}`
* `subseteq(e1, e2) \-> bool` : equivalent to `e1 & e2 == e1`
* `subset(e1, e2) \-> bool` : equivalent to `subseteq(e1, e2) && e1 != e2`

// But usually, we prefer to use operators.

[#not_not]
## `not`, `not not`, why not?
Instead of calling `any` and `none` we can use `operator!`

* `!e` : equivalent to `none(e)`
* `!!e` : equivalent to `any(e)`

## Everything in order?
[#overloading_relational_operators]
Let's take a look at the relational operators `<`, `\<=`, `>` and `>=`.

For enumerations (scoped and unscoped) C++ provides built-in relational operators which apply the operator to the values of the underlying type.
This order we usually want to use as _Compare_ predicate for sorted containers and sorting algorithms. 

This total order, is a linearization of a partial order which naturally arises, when we abstract away from the underlying type
 (which is what enumerations are usually about). It is the order induced by flag entailment:

[.text-center]
`e1 < e2`   if and only if   `subset(e1, e2) == true`

(xref:contained_induced_partial_order[see below])

But, if there is more than one flag, then this order is inherently partial and should never be used as _Compare_ predicate for containers or algorithms.

As there are applications for two different orders on the same type, the best would be different sets of relational operators, but C++ offers only one such. +
One approach would be, deleting all relational operators for flags and forcing the user to call a function / pass a _Compare_ type as predicate.

But here comes the next obstacle from the language:

[NOTE]
====
C++ allows overloading operators when at least one of its arguments is of `class` or `enum` type
[source]
----
enum E{};
bool operator<(E,E){ return true; }
bool test(){
    return E{} < E{};       // calls our operator< and returns true
}
----
This also works for operator templates, but there is one exception: +
When an operator template for a relational operator is invoked with the same enumeration type for both arguments, then the built-in operator is called.
[source]
----
enum E{};
template<typename T1, typename T2> bool operator<(T1,T2){ return true; }
bool test(){
    return E{} < E{};       // calls built-in < and returns false
}
----

There is a Defect Report pending
https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_active.html#2730[,window=_blank]
 which would make the latter also call the user defined operator template.
====

Currently, we simply cannot overload relational operators for Boost.Flags enabled enumerations with a function template - 
it requires the definition of a function. Thus Boost.Flags provides the following macros

* `BOOST_FLAGS_REL_OPS_DELETE(E)`: deletes all relational operators for enumeration `E`
* `BOOST_FLAGS_REL_OPS_PARTIAL_ORDER(E)`: defines all relational operators to reflect the partial order induced by `subseteq` (xref:contained_induced_partial_order[see below])

Additionally, there exist the following _Compare_ structs and objects:

* totally ordered: `struct boost::flags::total_order_t` and object `boost::flags::total_order`
* partially ordered: `struct boost::flags::partial_order_t` and object `boost::flags::partial_order`

As C++ allows to specialize `std::less` for user-defined types, we can provide a macro

* `BOOST_FLAGS_SPECIALIZE_STD_LESS(E)`: specializes `std::less` to use `boost::flags::total_order`

which ensures always total ordering for `std::less` based compare in containers and algorithms.

But for range-algorithms the language strikes back again: range compare uses
`std::ranges::less` which is a struct and thus cannot be specialized. Internally it will do some checks and call `operator <` if available. +
This means, when we define `BOOST_FLAGS_REL_OPS_PARTIAL_ORDER(E)` then for any range algorithm that compares values of type `E` we must provide
`boost::flags::total_order` (or another total ordering) as _Compare_. Otherwise, we're in UB land.

So, our recommendation (and the currently most comfortable way without loosing any safety) would be
defining both `BOOST_FLAGS_REL_OPS_DELETE(E)` and `BOOST_FLAGS_SPECIALIZE_STD_LESS(E)`.


[NOTE]
====
[#contained_induced_partial_order]
For the mathematically inclined programmer: +
The function `subseteq` reflects the partial order (in the mathematical sense) pass:[<span style="font-size:115%">&leq;</span>] of the generated Boolean algebra.
// The function `subseteq` reflects the partial order (in the mathematical sense) latexmath:[\leq] of the generated Boolean algebra.
You can enable relational operators using the `BOOST_FLAGS_REL_OPS_PARTIAL_ORDER` macro at global namespace. +
`BOOST_FLAGS_REL_OPS_PARTIAL_ORDER(E)` defines the following semantics for the relational operators

* `e1 \<= e2` : equivalent to `subseteq(e1, e2)`
* `e1 >= e2` : equivalent to `subseteq(e2, e1)`
* `e1 < e2` : equivalent to `subset(e1, e2)`
* `e1 > e2` : equivalent to `subset(e2, e1)`
* `e1 \<\=> e2` : has type `std::partial_ordering` and is equivalent to
[source]
----
    e1 == e2
    ? std::partial_ordering::equivalent
    : subseteq(e1, e2)
    ? std::partial_ordering::less
    : subseteq(e2, e1)
    ? std::partial_ordering::greater
    : std::partial_ordering::unordered

## Flags `and` Flags
Instead of `disjoint` and `intersect` we can write:

* `!(e1 & e2)` : equivalent to `disjoint(e1, e2)`
* `!!(e1 & e2)` : equivalent to `intersect(e1, e2)`

If we update existing code with Boost.Flags, then expressions like `e1 & e2` in Boolean contexts would have to be replaced by `!!(e1 & e2)`. This is tedious and requires adding parenthesis. +
Therefore, Boost.Flags provides a pseudo operator `BOOST_FLAGS_AND` with the same precedence and associativity as `&` but returning a `bool`:

* `e1 BOOST_FLAGS_AND e2` : equivalent to `!!(e1 & e2)` 

Alternatively, there is the options xref:boost_flags_logical_and[`logical_and`], which enables `operator&&`, see xref:logically_and_and_or[next section].

[NOTE]
====
`BOOST_FLAGS_AND` is a macro defined as `& boost::flags::pseudo_and_op_tag{} &`. +
The first `&` stores its left-hand argument in an intermediate type, which the second `&` evaluates with its right-hand argument.
====

[#logically_and_and_or]
## Logically `and` and `or`

The logical `operator &&` and `operator ||` have to handled with care, as they are the only ones to support short-circuit evaluation for the built-in versions.

Let's first take a look at the semantics of the built-in `operator &&`:

* it converts its first arguments to `bool`, if its `false` then returns `false` (short-circuit evaluation)
* otherwise converts the second arguments to `bool` and returns it

This is quite different from the semantics of the built-in bitwise `&` operator in a Boolean context:

* it performs intergral promotion on both arguments and compute their bitwise AND
* returns `false` if the outcome is equal to `0` otherwise `true`

E.g. in Boolean contexts `(1 && 2)` evaluates to `true`, while `(1 & 2)` evaluates to `false`.

Though, for `operator ||` and `operator |` and values `v1` and `v2`, in Boolean contexts `(v1 || v2)` and `(v1 | v2)` always evaluate to the same value, there is still the difference, that `operator ||` uses short-circuit evaluation and `operator |` does not.

Furthermore, `operator &&` and `operator ||` have lower precedences than `operator &` and `operator |` (cf. https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence[C++ Operator Precedence, window=_blank]), which is another source for errors.

Since logical operators `&&` and `||` can easily get confused with their bitwise counterparts `&` and `|`, by default Boost.Flags disables `operator&&` and  `operator||`, when both arguments are implicitly convertible to integral types, to prevent accidentally calling the built-in versions.

Nevertheless, sometimes `operator &&` comes in handy or is even required, e.g. when Boost.Flags is used together with other generic libraries. When for an enabled enumeration `E`
[source]
----
BOOST_FLAGS_ENABLE_LOGICAL_AND(E)

// resp. for a class local enum
BOOST_FLAGS_ENABLE_LOCAL_LOGICAL_AND(E)

// instead of 
// BOOST_FLAGS_ENABLE(E) 
// resp.
// BOOST_FLAGS_ENABLE_LOCAL(E) 
----
// is defined or `boost::flags::enable<E>` inherits from `boost::flags::logical_and`, 
is defined, then `operator &&` is overloaded for `E` with the semantics
[source]
----
    operator&&(e1, e2) -> bool { return !!(e1 & e2); } 
----
And once more, there is no short-circuit evaluation!

[WARNING]
====
When applying Boost.Flags to existing code, please be cautious enabling `operator&&` 

* it evaluates differently than the built-in version and doesn't provide short-circuit evaluation
* the usage of `operator&&` may have been wrong and `operator&` was intended

So, before enabling `operator&&`, it is best to compile the code without it and check whether the uses of `operator&&` are correct.
====

[NOTE]
====
To achieve short-circuit evaluation for expresions with flags, convert the flag-value arguments to `bool` by using e.g. `!!(...) && !!(...)` or `any(...) && any(...)`.
====


// [NOTE]
// ====
// Overloading `operator &&` and `operator ||` is not an option as it looses short-circuit evaluation, which would silently break exisiting code!
// 
// // Furthermore, due to the precedence rules, which for historical reasons gave logical operations a higher precedence than bitwise
// // https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html[,window=_blank]
// 
// // As already mentioned, there are no overloads for `operator&&` and `operator||`. +
// // Those overloads would loose _short-circuit_ evaluation, which could lead to runtime errors in existing code.

# Utilities

## Functions

Boost.Flags provides the following functions for an enabled enumeration `E`:

* `make_null(E) \-> E { return E{}; }`
* `make_if(E e, bool set) \-> E { return set ? e : E{}; }`
* `modify(E e, E mod, bool set)  \-> E { return set ? e | mod : e & ~mod; }`
* `modify_inplace(E& e, E mod, bool set)  \-> E& { e = modify(e, mod, set); return e; }`
* `add_if(E e, E mod, bool add)  \-> E { return add ? e | mod : e; }`
* `add_if_inplace(E& e, E mod, bool add)  \-> E& { e = add_if(e, mod, add); return e; }`
* `remove_if(E e, E mod, bool remove)  \-> E { return remove ? e & ~mod : e; }`
* `remove_if_inplace(E& e, E mod, bool remove)  \-> E& { e = remove_if(e, mod, remove); return e; }`
* `get_underlying(E e) \-> typename underlying_type<E>::type { return static_cast<typename underlying_type<E>::type>(e); }`
* `from_underlying(typename underlying_type<E>::type u) \-> E { return static_cast<E>(u); }`

All utility functions are defined in `namespace boost::flags`. +
The macro `BOOST_FLAGS_USING_UTILITIES()` imports all utility functions, except `from_underlying`, into the current naespace.

and for generating the values of enumerators:

* `template<typename T = int> nth_bit(unsigned int n) \-> underlying_or_identity<T>::type { return static_cast<underlying_or_identity<T>::type>(1) << n; }` +
  where type `T` can be either an enumeration or an integral type, and `underlying_or_identity` is a type-trait returning the underlying type of the enumeration or is the type-identity respectively
* `template<typename T> next_bit(T v) \-> T { return v << 1; }`

## Flags generator

Boost.Flags provides a `flag_generator` class template to iterate over the bits of a flag-enum. The class template is usually not create directly but through a call the one of the following functions
[source]
----
    // generates from first to last (incl.)
    constexpr flag_generator<E> flags_from_to(E first, E last);

    // generates from E(1) to last (incl.)
    constexpr flag_generator<E> flags_to(E last);               

    // generates all bits of the underlying type of E, starting from E(1)
    constexpr flag_generator<E> flags_all();
----

Example:
[source]
----
// using enum pizza_toppings from example above
auto base_toppings = pizza_toppings::tomato | pizza_toppings::cheese;
for (auto f : boost::flags::bits_to(pizza_toppings::garlic)) {
    if (boost::flags::any(f & base_toppings)) {
        std::cout << get_underlying(f) << "\n";
    }
}
----



The `template<typename E> flag_generator` provides an internal iterator and member functions `begin()` and `end()` returning the resp. iterators. +
It is contructed with the lowest and highest flag that shall be iterated over.
If `flag_generator` is constructor with flags not having exactly one bit set, then the behaviour is undefined.


// # Summary
// 
// * Boost.Flags makes bitwise operations type-safe.
// * For existing flag-sets, Boost.Flags provides an (almost) unintrusive way to detect semantical errors. The flag-sets can be turned into Boost.Flags enabled unscoped, or even better scoped, enumeration with almost no adjustments to the existing code required. 
// * For new defined flag-sets, we strongly suggest to use Boost.Flags enabled scoped enumerations as they provide the most type-safety and allow equality tests against `0`. 
// * Boost.Flags is zero-overhead.
