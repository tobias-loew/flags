# Design rationale

The design of Boost.Flags was driven by the following principles:

* type-safety
** the library shall enforce that binary operators can only be applied to flags or their complements from the same enumeration 
** flag values must be distinguished from their complements on the type-level

* non-intrusive
** as few as possible changes to the definition of existing flag-like enumeration shall be required
** no new types for flags, except `complement`

* opt-in shall be done by
** function overload or
** template specialization

* zero-overhead
** for optimized builds operator-calls must produce the same assembly code as built-in calls on the underlying integers

* no change of semantics for existing code
** enabling Boost.Flags for an existing flag-like enumeration must not produce valid code with different semantics 

The first four principles are met by the library. The last principle of course has a notable exception: 
 For a given enumeration `E` values of type `complement<E>` may invoke different overloads than values of `E`.
